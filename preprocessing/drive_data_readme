Data Organization on Google Drive

A. Log files:

Each mic. array in the ODAS system generates logs files.
A log is a data structure that contains info like:
	a. number of sound sources detected (max 4)
	b. intensity of each sound source
	c. x, y, and z coordinates of each source
	d. source id (this is useful for tracking)
	e. tag (when the source is moving, the tag is set to 'dynamic')
	f. timestamp
Each log file is associated with a start time. The log file is named according to this start time.


Log files are organized into folders based on which mic. array generates them.
For example, the folder 'logs0' contains log files generated by mic. array 0, and so on.
